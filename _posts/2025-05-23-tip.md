## What’s One Thing You’d Tell Someone Starting This Course?

Looking back, I'd say that not all the parts of this course were that helpful if you've already taken a python class. I suggest skipping to module 3. Or just skipping around on the site to whatever subjects seem unknown to you.

## What Did You Learn That Might Stick With You?

This project taught me how simple AI programs can be. You need to create models, train them, and then you can make predictions. It's that simple. 

## What Helped You Get Through Challenges?

Honestly, the biggest challenge was sitting still while watching these. So, I just took lots of notes, and doodles a bit, to maintain focus.

## What’s Next for You?

I'm not quite sure the specifics yet, but I'd have fun trying to design my own models. Maybe to predict liklihood of developing alzheimer's disease for people with TCF7L2 TT genotype (research I'm interested in)? Maybe I'll just goof off and design a fake experiment. Either way, knowing how much information is at my fingertips is really exciting.
