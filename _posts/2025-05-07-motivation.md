### Project Focus

The working title for this project is 'Intro to Data Science'. I plan on taking a short (6 module) course on data science. This is interesting to me because I would like to go into neuroscience, and for any science, data analysis is a necessary skill. This is challenging because we haven't covered data analysis in Intro to Python.

### Why This Project 

I was drawn to this idea because I love science. I wanted to do it now because it may be relevant to my research in alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes, in analyzing data. If I don't utilize it, it's still a good time to learn while python logic is fresh in my brain.

### What I Want to Learn

I'd like to stregnthen my understanding of panda, lists, it-statements, and while loops. This'll be doable because these are fundamental parts of data science. Personally, I'd like to understand how designing experiments envolves data science.



### My Approach 

I will prioritize understanding and taking good notes. I'll try to get as much done as early as possible, nonetheless. To me being "done enough" means having organized and clear thoughts, and legible code from the course.

### What's Next

I plan to tackle each lesson.
